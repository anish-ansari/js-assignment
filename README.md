1. What are nodes in the DOM?
   
   In DOM, all elements, attributes, text and other page components are arranged in a hierarchical tree-like structure with parents, children and siblings. These sections of the document are referred to as nodes. The topmost node is the root node with child `<html>` and it has other elements and so on.
